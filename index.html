    <h2>My Name, Year of School, Major</h2>
    <p>My name is Khai, and I am a junior, class of 2026, majoring in Computer Science.</p>

    <h2>Why Are You Taking This Course? What Are Your Goals?</h2>
    <p>I'm interested in web development, particularly front-end development,
        but I've never done this before. I also want a class that combines artistic elements
        with technology, and Critical Web Design offers both. My goal is to create user-friendly
        interfaces and learn web development tools that are essential in the field.</p>

    <h2>What Experience Do You Have Creating Content for the Web or Programming?</h2>
    <p>I don't have much experience in web development; I've mostly experimented with HTML and CSS.
        I know more about backend development with JavaScript and working with databases. I've also
        taken a few Computer Science classes at Davidson.</p>

    <h2>The Command Line</h2>
    <p>The tutorial introduces interacting with computers through text typing instead of using a GUI. 
        It covers essential basics like navigating the file system, creating and editing files, and 
        running programs using the command line. Key commands such as <code>whoami</code>, <code>touch</code>, 
        and <code>ls</code> are highlighted, along with an introduction to shell programming. The tutorial also
        demonstrates how to run a Python file using Vim, a text editor available in the command line.</p>
