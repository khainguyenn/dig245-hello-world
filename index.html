    <h2>My Name, Year of School, Major</h2>
    <p>My name is Khai, and I am a junior, class of 2026, majoring in Computer Science.</p>

    <h2>Why Are You Taking This Course? What Are Your Goals?</h2>
    <p>I'm interested in web development, particularly front-end development,
        but I've never done this before. I also want a class that combines artistic elements
        with technology, and Critical Web Design offers both. My goal is to create user-friendly
        interfaces and learn web development tools that are essential in the field.</p>

    <h2>What Experience Do You Have Creating Content for the Web or Programming?</h2>
    <p>I don't have much experience in web development; I've mostly experimented with HTML and CSS.
        I know more about backend development with JavaScript and working with databases. I've also
        taken a few Computer Science classes at Davidson.</p>

    <h2>The Command Line</h2>
    <p>The tutorial introduces interacting with computers through text typing instead of using a GUI.
        It covers essential basics like navigating the file system, creating and editing files, and
        running programs using the command line. Key commands such as <code>whoami</code>, <code>touch</code>,
        and <code>ls</code> are highlighted, along with an introduction to shell programming. The tutorial also
        demonstrates how to run a Python file using Vim, a text editor available in the command line.</p>

    <h2>Websites</h2>
    <p>Here are some websites I like:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3><a href="https://stars.chromeexperiments.com/">100,000 Stars</a></h3>
            <p>This website provides a visually stunning interactive visualization of our galaxy. It allows you to explore a
                detailed 3D map of stars, making it an excellent educational tool, especially for people who learn best
                visually. I find it fascinating that such an immersive experience can be created using code and technology.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3><a href="https://anatomyof.ai/">Anatomy of an AI System</a></h3>
            <p>This website gives users a thought-provoking visual and
                analytical breakdown of AI life cycle. I'm very interested in its detailed exploration of the hidden costs,
                labor, and data that go
                into creating AI. I think it is an essential resource for understanding the broader implications of AI
                development.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Difficulties</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I think the most difficult part was grasping the deadline and structure of the syllabus.</li>
        <li>Regarding the assignment itself, the open-endedness of the question gave me some time to think about how to use HTML elements appropriately.</li>
    </ul>
